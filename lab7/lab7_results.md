**Task 2.2**
1. The discrimination scores tell us that UniXcoder is better than the generic discrimination. 

**Task 2.3**
1. Yes, it recognizes that it is the same even though it might have some small changes such as variable name changes.
2. It handles pretty well, we know this by looking at the similarity scores and with_typing is at the top of the list with 0.9538, so in the case of renaming the variables or with typing UniXcoder does a great job at recognizing that it is functionally the same.  

**Task 2.4**
1. Yes, when running this code we saw the number of changes were increasing.
