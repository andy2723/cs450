**Task 2.1**
1. A basic description is just a one line sentence describing the contents of the image, a good example of an alt text. The detailed description though gives a description of the over impression and even goes into the colors, landscape, and context.
2. We think that it focuses a lot on color, I think it also focuses a lot on the environment noting details like natural grass, or mentioning it could be a desert.

**Task 3.2**
1. Adding guidelines does help as it gives the model more leverage to base its answers on. 
2. I think the guidelines help the most in situations where the model needs guidance because it could be either category.

**Task 4.1**
1. It was accurate in describing what the object was, but not in the circle count. We counted at least 25 dots, and the model said there was 21.
2. We uploaded the yoga instructor photo and it counted 1 circle. We were very curious as to what the model thinks the circle is lol.
